## Usage
Using the model for inference
```python
from DirectMHP_Inference_seoy import DirectMHP

model = DirectMHP(weights='path/to/weights', device=device)
```

To save model in onnx format
```python
from DirectMHP_Inference_seoy import save_with_weights

save_with_weights(weights='path/to/weights', device='device')
```
or run the save_model script in the package
